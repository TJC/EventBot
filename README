Hi,
This is EventBot, version, erm, approximately 2.0.

I suggest you visit the wiki page for up-to-date info:
http://wiki.github.com/TJC/EventBot/gettingstarted

To deploy the database: script/eventbot_deploy.pl eventbot

To run the webserver: script/eventbot_www_server.pl -r -d
Then visit it on http://localhost:3000/

The mail filter is script/eventbot_maild.pl which is designed to work as a
procmail filter, and expects one email at a time to be piped in via STDIN.

Please raise any issues (or wishlists) at http://github.com/TJC/EventBot/issues

A wiki is also available at: http://wiki.github.com/TJC/EventBot

Don't forget to set the NOCAPTCHA_KEY and NOCAPTCHA_SECRET environment variables.
The defaults only work for localhost.

-Toby
